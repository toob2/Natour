importing the _base.scss file acc to the 7-1 architecture, we dont have to use the _ or .scss, just the path in the fold base/base - its enough for the sass to understand what do we wanna import

this architecture might be a bit of an overkill for a small project, but once you start working on a huge project, you are gonna appreciate how helpful it is

imagine having 10k lines of code
